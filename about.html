              Painfully shy Todd Anderson has been sent to the school where his
              popular older brother was valedictorian. His roommate, Neil Perry,
              although exceedingly bright and popular, is very much under the
              thumb of his overbearing father. The two, along with their other
              friends, meet Professor Keating, their new English teacher, who
              tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to go
              against the status quo. Each does so in his own way, and is
              changed for life.

          Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American drama film directed by Peter
          Weir, written by Tom Schulman, and starring Robin Williams. Set in
          1959 at the fictional elite conservative Vermont boarding school
          Welton Academy, it tells the story of an English teacher who inspires
          his students through his teaching of poetry.<br />
          <br />
          In the autumn of 1957, shy Todd Anderson begins his senior year of
          high school at Welton Academy, an all-male, elite prep school. He is
          assigned one of Welton's most promising students, Neil Perry, as his
          roommate and is quickly accepted by Neil's friends: Knox Overstreet,
          Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton. On
          the first day of classes, they are surprised by the unorthodox
          teaching methods of the new English teacher John Keating, a Welton
          alumnus who encourages his students to "make your lives
          extraordinary", a sentiment he summarizes with the Latin expression
          carpe diem. Subsequent lessons include having them take turns standing
          on his desk to teach the boys how they must look at life in a
          different way, telling them to rip out the introduction of their
          poetry books which explains a mathematical formula used for rating
          poetry, and inviting them to make up their own style of walking in a
          courtyard to encourage them to be individuals. His methods attract the
          attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan. Upon learning that Keating
          was a member of the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society while he was at
          Welton, Neil restarts the club and he and his friends sneak off campus
          to a cave where they read poetry and verse, including their own
          compositions. As the school year progresses, Keating's lessons and
          their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on
          their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a girl who is dating a
          football player from a public school and whose family is friends with
          his. Neil discovers his love of acting and gets the role as Puck in a
          local production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, despite the fact that
          his domineering father wants him in the Ivy League (and ultimately
          medical school). Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize
          his potential when he takes him through an exercise in
          self-expression, resulting in his composing a poem spontaneously in
          front of the class. However, Charlie takes things too far when he
          publishes an article in the school newspaper in the club's name
          demanding that girls be admitted to Welton. Nolan uses corporal
          punishment to coerce Charlie into revealing who else is in the Dead
          Poets Society, but he resists. Nolan also speaks with Keating, warning
          him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority.
          Keating does admonish the boys (in his manner), warning that one must
          assess all consequences. Neil's father discovers Neil's involvement in
          the play and forces him to quit on the eve of the opening performance.
          Devastated, Neil goes to Keating, who advises him to stand his ground
          and prove to his father that his love of acting is something he takes
          seriously. Neil's father unexpectedly shows up at the performance. He
          takes Neil home and says he has been withdrawn from Welton, only to be
          enrolled in a military academy to prepare him for Harvard. Unable to
          find the courage to stand up to his father and with no help from his
          mother, a distraught Neil commits suicide. Nolan investigates Neil's
          death at the request of the Perry family. Cameron blames Neil's death
          on Keating to escape punishment for his own participation in the Dead
          Poets Society, and names the other members. Confronted by Charlie,
          Cameron urges the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie
          punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's
          office to sign a letter attesting to the truth of Cameron's
          allegations, even though they know they are false. When Todd's turn
          comes, he is reluctant to sign, but does so after seeing that the
          others have complied and succumbing to his parents' pressure. Keating
          is fired and Nolan takes over teaching the class. Keating interrupts
          the class to collect personal articles; before he leaves, Todd shouts
          that all of them were forced to sign the letter that resulted in his
          dismissal and that Neil's death was not his fault. Todd stands on his
          desk and salutes Keating with the words "O Captain! My Captain!".
          Knox, Gerard, Steven, and over half of the class do the same, defying
          a furious Nolan's orders to sit down. Keating is deeply touched by
          their gesture. He thanks the boys and departs.
