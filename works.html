				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">Robin Williams</h4>
					<div class="work-text">“Carpe diem.Seize the day, boys.
Make your lives extraordinary” </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">Greg Bear</h4>
					<div class="work-text">“Once, poets were magicians. Poets were strong, stronger than warriors or kings — stronger than old hapless gods. And they will be strong once again.” </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">E.M. Forster</h4>
					<div class="work-text">“It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” </div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">Sanober Khan</h4>
					<div class="work-text">“in a world full of temporary things you are a perpetual feeling.” </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">Soren Kierkegaard</h4>
					<div class="work-text"> “What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful.” </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
					<h4 class="work-name">Plato</h4>
					<div class="work-text">“Poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand.” </div>
				</div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Vladimir Nabokov</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer. No, no, I was neither. Ladies and gentleman of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill.” </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">G.K. Chesterton</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“Imagination does not breed insanity. Exactly what does breed insanity is reason. Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do. Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom. I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic: I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination.” </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Jane Kenyon</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“The poet's job is to put into words those feelings we all have that are so deep, so important, and yet so difficult to name, to tell the truth in such a beautiful way, that people cannot live without it.” </div>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Sylvia Plath</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“I think writers are the most narcissistic people. Well, I musn't say this, I like many of them, a great many of my friends are writers.” </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Walt Whitman</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“I act as the tongue of you,<br/> ... tied in your mouth . . . . in mine it begins to be loosened.”</div>

        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Socrates</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled [poets] to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.” </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">Wendell Berry</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“Again I resume the long <br/>
lesson: how small a thing <br/>
can be pleasing, how little <br/>
in this hard world it takes <br/>
to satisfy the mind <br/>
and bring it to its rest.” </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 work-box">
          <h4 class="work-name">A. E. Housman</h4>
          <div class="work-text">“Therefore, since the world has still <br/>
Much good, but much less good than ill, <br/>
And while the sun and moon endure <br/>
Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure, <br/>
I'd face it as a wise man would, <br/>
And train for ill and not for good.” </div>
